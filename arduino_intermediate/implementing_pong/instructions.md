# Implementing Pong
Now that you've gone through the exercises, you're ready to take on the main challenge. You'll be using what you've learned to create a complete implementation of the Pong game. Find the **starter.ino** file and familiarize yourself with it. Make mental notes of what's already there and whats missing. 

Before you start, here are some hints to keep in mind. 

1. Paddle direction changes should be implemented using button polling. 
2. The pause button should be implemented using an interrupt
3. It will not be sufficient to simply copy and past the code from the exersises. Think about what you've learned, and how you can extend it. For example, the button polling code only implemented oen button, but actually you're dealing with *two different players*. 
4. The **interrupts** module mentioned using alternatives to *CHANGE* mode; consider what those two alternatives were and why they might be useful.


## Usefule Code Snippets

### 1 Paddle Directions
In Pong, we will be using 3 buttons. Buttons 1 and 2 will be used to control the paddles of P1 and P2. When designing your game, read the button states to determine the direction of the paddles. Pressing button1 should flip the direction of player 1’s paddles while pressing button2 should flip the direction of player 2’s paddles. 

The code below is what the logic for flipping the paddle direction might look like, but it is incomplete.  Think about where the paddle direction flags should be declared. 

Take a look at the skeleton code and paste the sections of this block you need into the skeleton.

````cpp
/* If the button states for either player change from Low to HIGH, 
the paddle direction is flipped p1 and p2Dir need to be declared as const int before your setup. 
Assign them a value to determine their speed. */ 

/* If the state of the player1 button is high, the direction of the paddle is flipped. 
lastBtnP1 tracks the state of the button on the previous loop of the code. 
This is called edge detection and detects the change of the button state. */

if (lastBtnP1 == HIGH && btnP1 == LOW) {

      // If the paddle is not moving at the bottom, set dir +ve. Else if paddle is not moving, set dir -ve.
      if (p1Dir == 0) {
        p1Dir = (P1_Y <= 0) ? 1 : -1;

      } else { // If direction is not 0, flip p1Dir
        p1Dir *= -1;
      }
}

// Paddle movement
P1_Y += p1Dir; // This is what actually updates the paddle location

// Above is the paddle movement for paddle1. Repeat the above code with the corresponding variable names for paddle2.
````

How do we stop the paddles from extending past the screen borders? We need to compare the borders of the paddles with the size of the screen. If the paddles reach the edge, the directions must be set to zero (not moving).


This can be copied into the corresponding section of the skeleton code to add paddle constraint functionality.

````cpp
if (P1_Y <= 0 || P1_Y >= SCREEN_HEIGHT - PADDLE_HEIGHT) {
    // constrain prevents the paddle from extending beond the screen

    P1_Y = constrain(P1_Y, 0, SCREEN_HEIGHT - PADDLE_HEIGHT);
    p1Dir = 0;
}
````

### 2 Game Logic
The game logic for Pong can be broken down into several components. 

Before starting the game, wait for a player input. After receiving input wait for input from player 2. After both players are ready, the game can enter the playing state and the game begins.

Ball movement and positioning is broken down into X and Y components. By storing a separate variable for the speed of the ball in the X and Y, movement can be simulated by adding the velocity to the position every loop of the code. When the ball collides with the borders or paddles, the ball velocity is flipped. 

Collision is determined by comparing the position of the ball with the position of the paddles and borders. Ball position overlaps, X or Y velocity correspondingly flips. 

This code can be pasted into corresponding sections of the skeleton code to add collusion and movement functionality.


````cpp
ballX += ballVX;
ballY += ballVY;
// This is the movement for the ball. Similar to the paddles, every loop of the code will update the position

// Paddle collision

/* This will flip the direction of the ball on contact with a paddle. 
It takes into account the width of the paddle when creating hitboxes. */

/* Remember, P1_Y and P2_Y represent the bottom of the paddles and 
the collision zones must be "extended" by the paddle height. */

if (ballX <= P1_X + PADDLE_WIDTH &&
    ballY >= P1_Y && ballY <= P1_Y + PADDLE_HEIGHT) {
    ballVX *= -1;
    ballX = P1_X + PADDLE_WIDTH + 1;
}

if (ballX >= P2_X - 1 &&
    ballY >= P2_Y && ballY <= P2_Y + PADDLE_HEIGHT) {
    ballVX *= -1;
    ballX = P2_X - 2;
}
/* This is collision for the balls and paddles. 
Fill in collision for the top and bottom of the screen.
If the ball reaches the */
````


## Challenges

### 1 Boundaries
Currently, there is no logic for the ball colliding with the top and bottom walls of the game. 	Add logic to reverse the vertical direction of the ball when would go out of bounds vertically. 

This code can be added to the corresponding section of the skeleton to add collision functionality with the tpo and bottom of the screen.	

````cpp
if (ballY <= 0 || ballY >= SCREEN_HEIGHT - 2) {
    // This is the bounds of top and bottom the screen. What happens when the ball hits the bounds?

}
````

### 2 Scoring 

Scoring is achieved by checking if the ball has contacted either side of the border, without contacting the paddles. Recreate the below code for a player 2 score as well.

This code can be added to the corresponding section of the skeleton to add scoring functionality

````cpp
if (ballX < 0) {
    scoreP2++;
	resetRound();
}

if (ballX > SCREEN_WIDTH) {
    scoreP1++;
	resetRound();
}

/* This is the scoring for one side of the screen. A similar code 
block must be written for the opposite side, change the variables! */

````

### 3 Reset
Complete the resetRound function so that it resets the position of the ball when it is called. 

### 4 Win Criteria

Decide what value constitutes a winning score. Change your game so that after a player reaches that score, a “game over” is triggered. Include some way of resetting the game so the players can play again.

### 5 Make it your own 

Using the tools you’ve learned, create a working game of Pong. Use button polling to read user inputs and control the direction and movement of paddles and interrupts to control pause functionality or any other functions. Try to implement a timer and game clock. Find the skeleton for the functions and code you need to get started on LEARN.

- Experiment with the game. Change the size of the ball or paddles
- Have ready screens for each player
- Change the speed of the ball or paddles
- Change the scale of the time
