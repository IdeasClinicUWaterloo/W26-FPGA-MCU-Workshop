# Welcome to the Arduino Intermediate Workshop!

This intermediate workshop builds on prior knowledge of microcontrollers and introduces polling loops, interrupts, and timers.
Microcontrollers are small one-chip computers that are at the core of much of today’s technology to automate and control tasks. Generally, they have a Central Processing Unit (CPU), some memory, and programmable input and output ports.

With polling loops, our code manually checks the status of any input pins at a regular interval, and then we can respond. Interrupts are used for more critical events so that the code can respond more quickly. 

These concepts will be used to create a simple, 2-player version of the game Pong.
