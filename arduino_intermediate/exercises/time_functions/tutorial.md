# Time Functions 

The Arduino R4 has built in real time 32-bit clocks. These clocks are used to provide PWM functionality, precise time measurements and delay functionality. On a low level (meaning no abstraction), these clocks operate on 128Hz. After a certain amount of clock cycles, the timer will “overflow” meaning its maxed out its 32-bit capacity, and trigger an overflow event. This overflow event can be used to track intervals of time or create time sensitive functionality. Manipulating the timer chips requires accessing the hardware control registers and bits.  

The Arduino IDE thankfully abstracts all of this behind various built-in libraries and functions. In order to add our game clock, we will be using the function millis(). millis() will return the amount of milliseconds that have passed since the MCU was activated. On a low level, the timers are configured to overflow every millisecond, millis() will return the number of overflows that have occurred.  

Arduino IDE also includes many other time functions. delay() uses the hardware timers to precisely pause the CPU and micros() will return the microseconds since the MCU was activated. analogWrite() and PWM signal generation also uses the hardware timers but have abstracted them away behind functions and libraries.

## Challenge
1. The code above will return the time since the Arduino powered on, in milliseconds.  We would like you to display the game time in the format MM:SS. You need to copy your solution from the **connect_to_screen** module to this module's **starter.ino** file. Then, write code to calculate the minutes and seconds and store them in variables.

2. Add your code from the **interrupts** module to your new code. Implement logic such that if the pause button has been pressed (interrupt button from **interrupts** module), the displayed timer stops progressing. Once the pause button is pressed again, the timer should resume.
