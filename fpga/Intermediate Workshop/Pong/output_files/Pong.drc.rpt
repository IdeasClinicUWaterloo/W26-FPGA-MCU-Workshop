Warning (18236): Number of processors has not been specified which may cause overloading on shared machines.  Set the global assignment NUM_PARALLEL_PROCESSORS in your QSF to an appropriate value for best performance.
Critical Warning (332012): Synopsys Design Constraints File file not found: 'Pong.sdc'. A Synopsys Design Constraints File is required by the Timing Analyzer to get proper timing constraints. Without it, the Compiler will not properly optimize the design.
Info (332144): No user constrained generated clocks found in the design

Info (332096): The command derive_clocks did not find any clocks to derive.  No clocks were created or changed.
Info (332097): The following timing edges are non-unate.  The Timing Analyzer will assume pos-unate behavior for these edges in the clock network.
