# Welcome to the FPGA Intermediate Workshop!

In this workshop, you will build a functional version of Pong. You will combine several pre-built elements with your own VHDL to display patterns over HDMI, keep track of game objects and state, and render the game. By the end of this workshop, you should be able to: 

- Understand the advantages of licensed IP cores and how to use them in Quartus Prime 
- Learn how to write reusable logic and integrate multiple components together to create a cohesive product 
- Know how and when to use conditional assignments 

# Required Materials 

- FPGA development board
- USB cable for programming
- Monitor
- HDMI cable
- Project files from this repository
- Intel Quartus Prime Lite Edition installed.
