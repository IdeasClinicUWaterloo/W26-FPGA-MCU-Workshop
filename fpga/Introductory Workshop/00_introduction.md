# Introduction to FPGAs and Quartus

## What is an FPGA?

An FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) is a type of integrated circuit that can be programmed to perform specific digital logic functions. Unlike a microcontroller that runs software instructions, an FPGA implements hardware circuits directly.

## What is Quartus Prime?

Intel Quartus Prime is the development software used to design, simulate, and program FPGAs. It provides tools for:
- Writing hardware description code (Verilog/VHDL)
- Simulating your designs
- Synthesizing logic circuits
- Programming FPGA boards

## Workshop Overview

In this workshop, you will learn how to:
- Create FPGA projects in Quartus
- Design basic digital logic circuits
- Simulate your designs
- Program an FPGA board

The workshop is divided into four activities that progressively build your understanding of FPGA design.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- Intel Quartus Prime Lite Edition installed ([installation guide](quartus_setup/README.md))
- Downloaded the workshop files from this repository
- An FPGA development board and USB cable
