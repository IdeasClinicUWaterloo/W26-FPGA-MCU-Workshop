# Welcome to the FPGA Introductory Workshop!

This introductory workshop will teach you the fundamentals of VHDL and FPGAs using Quartus.

FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) are integrated circuits that can be configured by the user after manufacturing. Unlike microcontrollers that execute instructions sequentially, FPGAs allow you to create custom hardware circuits that operate in parallel.

This workshop will guide you through creating digital logic circuits, from simple gates to controlling a seven segment display.

# Required Materials

- Intel Quartus Prime Lite Edition installed
- FPGA development board
- USB cable for programming
- Project files from this repository

If you haven't installed Quartus yet:
