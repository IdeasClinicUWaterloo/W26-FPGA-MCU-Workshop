# Welcome to the Arduino Introduction Activity!

# Microcontrollers

Microcontrollers are small one-chip computers that are at the core of much of today’s 
technology to automate and control tasks. Generally, they have a Central Processing 
Unit (CPU), some memory, and programmable input and output ports. This workshop 
introduces you to the essentials of using an Arduino Uno, a popular microcontroller. 
You’ll learn how to build and control simple digital and analog circuits, send and 
receive data signals between devices, and generate Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) 
signals to control external devices. In the process you’ll use breadboards, meters and 
scopes.
